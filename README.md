## Overview 
IBM DevOps Services has a Continuous Delivery Pipeline for deploying Cloud Foundry applications, containers, and micro-services to IBM Bluemix. You can use a textual representation of a pipeline defined by a pipeline.yml file, which makes it easy to share and copy interesting pipelines. The Deploy to Bluemix button provides a simple way to clone a project that includes the source files and the Delivery Pipeline configuration. 

## The application 
Helloworld node application

## The pipeline 
As simple as it gets
- Build 
    + Leverages the container build service to take the Dockerfile in the root of the project, builds a docker image that is versioned by tagging based on the build number, and pushes the image to your orgnanization's registry on IBM Bluemix. 
- Deploy 
    + â€¢ Using the container image from the Build stage, a container group is deployed with a single container to start with, and then a route is generated for the Deploy stage that will be reused across deployments.
